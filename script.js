                        The Empower Mobile Application signifies the commencement of my project portfolio at PT ITC Auto Multi Finance, primarily aimed at diminishing operational expenses (OPEX). In the erstwhile system, sales counters were burdened with laptops, an expensive and unwieldy solution, to gain access to our backend site, Empower Web. This platform served as a sales counter tool, facilitating customers in securing new loans for smartphone purchases or processing loan applications submitted via PayKu Mobile. This process has been streamlined and simplified with the introduction of the Empower Mobile App.
                        <br>
                        The interaction between sales counters and customers is very important, particularly during the credit calculation phase prior to contract finalization, a critical juncture for us, which this stage is now managed within the Empower Mobile App. Furthermore, the installation procedure for Mobile Device Management (MDM) on Empower Web has been simplified for easier utilization by sales counters via the Empower Mobile App.

                        Following meticulous consultations with our Risk and Product departments, we have reached the consensus that the potential growth of the retail market may not be sufficient to counterbalance the negative impact of our current receivablesâ€™ aging. Consequently, we have developed the PayKu Premium program. Originally designed for the B2B2E market, we identified a unique opportunity to tailor an application specifically for this purpose.

                        Empower Web has been, and continues to be, an integral tool utilized by internal team of PT ITC Auto Multi Finance. It serves various departments, ranging from acquisitions to finance and accounting. This platform is the primary collection and processing point for all new credit applications. However, it is important to clarify that Empower Web does not function as a Loan Management System. Instead, it acts as a conduit to our existing loan management system namely Confins, where details of installments and payment histories are documented.

                        At Vantsing International Group, my initial assignment involved the development of a comprehensive Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. This sophisticated platform was engineered to streamline a multitude of operations including, but not limited to, management of purchase orders, sales orders, delivery orders, invoices, returned goods, warehouse operations, customer relations, and inventory. This project served as a significant milestone in my professional journey, providing a robust foundation for my future endeavors.

                        Soldays represented the second significant project entrusted to me, marking a pivotal shift in strategic direction. Consequently, my responsibilities were augmented to encompass the enhancement of the existing ERP systemâ€™s functionalities. Additionally, I was commissioned to architect an E-commerce system, further broadening the scope of my professional expertise. This project underscored my ability to adapt to new visions and deliver innovative solutions.
